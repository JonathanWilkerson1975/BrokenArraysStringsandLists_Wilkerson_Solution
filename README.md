# BrokenArraysStringsandLists_Wilkerson_Solution

I fixed three main problems in the original code:

First, the array insertion was broken - it was shifting elements the wrong way and would eventually crash when trying to delete items. I fixed it by shifting elements to the right instead of left, which properly makes space for new values without losing data.

Second, the string building was incredibly slow because it kept creating new strings over and over. I used StringBuilder instead, which handles large text operations efficiently without the performance penalty.

Third, the list operations were crashing in two ways: trying to insert at invalid positions and modifying the list while looping through it. I fixed both by using simple Add instead of Insert, and by using a backward loop that safely removes items without breaking.

All these changes keep the original purpose of the code while making it actually work properly without crashes or massive slowdowns.
